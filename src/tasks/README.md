# Task Folder Details

Note: Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub-folders within the task.
- __Update the table below explaining the task details.__
