# Dataset Documentation
## Dataset Overview
The dataset for face shape recognition is used to train models to classify and predict different face shapes based on facial features. These datasets typically contain images of individuals with labeled face shapes and may also include metadata about each image.
## Dataset Sources
The data has been collected from these sources: 
- https://www.kaggle.com
- https://github.com
## Dataset Details
### Images
- Format: Common formats include JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.
- Resolution: Varies; high-resolution images are preferable for better accuracy but can be larger.
- Size: Can range from hundreds to thousands of images, depending on the dataset.
Labels:
### Face Shape Categories: 
- Labels: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and oblong.
- Annotations: Each image is annotated with the face shape it represents.
## Preprocessing steps
- Alignment: Align faces to ensure consistency in feature extraction.
- Normalization: Adjust image lighting and color to standardize inputs.
- Augmentation: Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase dataset diversity.
