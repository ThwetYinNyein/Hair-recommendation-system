        - **Longer Layers:** Opt for hairstyles with longer layers that soften the angular features of a heart-shaped face.

        - **Soft Curls or Waves:** Soft curls or waves can add volume and create a more rounded appearance.
        - **Avoid Volume on Top:** Avoid hairstyles that add too much volume on top, as this can accentuate the heart shape.
